# RPG

A turn-based RPG developed using Godot Engine<br>
This project was created based on Gurpreet Singh Matharoo's version of a turn-based rpg created with GameMaker Studio<br>
You can find his code at:<br>
https://github.com/gurpreetsinghmatharoo/gms2.3-turn-based-rpg<br>

I tried to recreate his game but using Godot instead of GameMaker<br>
It's not 100% similar, but it's pretty close<br>

I also added some features that are not present in his project<br>
I just felt like adding them would be nice, so I did<br>

Web version of the game:<br>
